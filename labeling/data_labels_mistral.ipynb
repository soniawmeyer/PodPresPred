            "Explanation: The segment expresses surprise and excitement about the speaker's encounter with triplets, but it also includes a few negative comments about Trump, which strengthens the sentiment towards him. The speaker uses exclamations like \"oh lord,\" \"oh goodness,\" and \"oh god\" in response to the unexpected discovery of triplets, but also mentions how Trump's election \"completely changed [their] life\" in a negative way. The speaker also uses the phrase \"inappropriate question\" when discussing the discovery of the third triplet, which could be interpreted as a criticism of Trump or the situation in general. Overall, the sentiment towards Trump is more negative than neutral.\n",
